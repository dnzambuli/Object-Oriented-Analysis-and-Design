# Object Oriented Analysis and Design

Using software engineering methodology that employs `object oriented` principles to model and design complex systems

## Advantages
1. **Scalable Solution** -- analyzing the problem domain to extract features that are represented as `objects` and `their interactioms`. Allowing for mudular solutions
2. **Easy to Understand** -- extends functionality into reuseable and interconnected components
3. **Easy to maintain**

## Terms 

### Object-oriented Programming 
modeling real-worl objects as software objects
- properties and models are used to represent the behaviour or those objects

### Design Patterns
Reuseable solutions to common problems in software design.

### UML diagrams
**Unified Modeling Language** (UML) -- standardized notation for creating diagrams to represent different aspects of a software system.
- represent the different components and interactions for a software system

### Use cases
Describing the different ways in which users interact with a software system.
