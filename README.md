# Object Oriented Analysis and Design

Using software engineering methodology that employs `object oriented` principles to model and design complex systems

## Advantages
1. **Scalable Solution** -- analyzing the problem domain to extract features that are represented as `objects` and `their interactioms`. Allowing for mudular solutions
2. **Easy to Understand** -- extends functionality into reuseable and interconnected components
3. **Easy to maintain**

# Key Aspects

- [OO analysis](oo-analysis.md)
- [oo design](oo-design.md)
- advantages of OO analysis and design `OOAD`
- [real world applications](realWorldAp.md)
___

## Terms 

### Object-oriented Programming 
modeling real-worl objects as software objects
- properties and models are used to represent the behaviour or those objects

### Design Patterns
Reuseable solutions to common problems in software design.

### UML diagrams
**Unified Modeling Language** (UML) -- standardized notation for creating diagrams to represent different aspects of a software system.
- represent the different components and interactions for a software system

### Use cases
Describing the different ways in which users interact with a software system.


# Java
`Java` is an `Object-Oriented ` programming language developed by James Gosling in the early 1990s. 

## C++ vs Java

| Topic | C++ | Java|
|-----|-----|-----|
|Memory Management|	Use of pointers, structures, union|	No use of pointers. Supports references, thread and interfaces.|
|Libraries|	Comparatively available with low-level functionalities|	Wide range of classes for various high-level services|
|Multiple Inheritance|Provide both single and multiple inheritance.|Multiple inheritances is partially done through interfaces|
|Operator Overloading|	Supports operator overloading|It doesnâ€™t support this feature|
|Program Handling|Functions and variables can reside outside classes.|Functions and variables reside only in classes, packages are used.|
|Portability|Platform dependent, must be recompiled for different platform|Platform independent, byte code generated works on every OS.|
|Thread Support|No built-in support for threads, depends on libraries.|It has built-in thread support.|


## Python vs Java
|Topic|Java|Python|
|-----|-----|------|
|Compilation process|Java is both compiled and interpreted language, which is first compiled and then interpreted into a byte code.	|Python is an interpreted programming language|
|Code Length|Longer lines of code as compared to python.|3-5 times shorter than equivalent Java programs.|
|Syntax Complexity|Define particular block by curly braces, end statements by ;|No need of semi colons and curly braces, uses indentation|
|Ease of typing|Strongly typed, need to define the exact datatype of variables|	Dynamic, no need to define the exact datatype of variables.|
|Speed of execution|Java is much faster than python in terms of speed.|Expected to run slower than Java programs|
|Multiple Inheritance|Multiple inheritance is partially done through interfaces|Provide both single and multiple inheritance|

## JVE JRE and JDK
- general-purpose computer programming language 
- is concurrent
- class-based
- object-oriented

Java applications are typically compiled to `bytecode` that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.

1. **JDK(Java Development Kit)**: JDK is intended for software developers and includes development tools such as:
-  the Java compiler
-  Javadoc
-  Jar,and 
-  a debugger.
  

2. **JRE(Java Runtime Environment)**: JRE contains the parts of the `Java libraries` required to run Java programs and is intended for end-users. 
- JRE can be viewed as a subset of JDK.

3. **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides `a runtime environment` in which java bytecode can be executed. 
- JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms.
