# Object-oriented Programming
- The `first step` of object oriented software engineering.

- involves modeling real-world objects as software objects

## Key concepts
1. **Information domain is modeling** -- making  a map of everything important

- getting the characters and features of the world
- how they interact

2. **Behaviour representation** -- describing the actions each character can do

- scripting for each character

3. **Function description** -- listing and describing the specific tasts a program has to do.

- software to-do list

4. **uncovering details** -- splits tasks into `things known`, `things to be done` and `how things behave`
5. **Simple to detailed** -- starting from a simple version, as more features are added precision is improved. 
`adding color and details to a simple sketch`
